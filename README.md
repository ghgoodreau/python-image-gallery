# An Amazon EC2-based python image gallery manager

Deployed via [its ansible counterpart](https://github.com/ghgoodreau/ansible_image_gallery), this load-balanced application is hosted in the AWS cloud via a VPC and RDS instance.

## What is it

A simple image gallery that users can upload and view images on. Log in, upload and delete images, and view all the images you have uploaded. 

## Steps to reproduce

To reproduce, you will need to rename the certain variables contained within the project with your corresponding resources (for instance, changing to YOUR s3 bucket). More specific instructions are coming eventually.
